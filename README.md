# ChatBot Deployment using IBM Watson Assistant

## Project Overview
This project involves deploying a chatbot using IBM Watson Assistant. The chatbot is designed to handle user queries and provide appropriate responses based on the configured intents and entities.

## Features
- Natural language understanding
- Predefined and custom intents
- Entity recognition
- Context management
- Multi-turn conversations

## Technologies Used
- IBM Watson Assistant
- Node.js (for deployment)
- Cloud services (e.g., IBM Cloud)

## Setup Instructions
1. IBM Watson Assistant Setup:
   - Create an IBM Cloud account.
   - Set up an IBM Watson Assistant service instance.
   - Create a workspace and configure intents, entities, and dialog nodes.

2. Local Environment Setup:
   - Install Node.js and npm.
   - Clone this repository.
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`

3. Deployment:
   - Follow the deployment instructions in the `config/deployment_instructions.md`.

## Usage
Interact with the chatbot by sending messages through the provided interface. The chatbot will process the input and respond accordingly.
